<h1>DIAGRAMS</h1>


In the Component and Sequence Diagrams I aggregated objects which
perform similar functions (Views, View Helpers, Command, Business
Delegates, Session Bean Processors...). For instance, in the Prepare
Itinerary sequence diagram, all Views (Search Flight,Select
Flight,Select Seats, Confirm Itinerary ) are represented by the same
object.<br>


In the Sequence Diagrams it is not shown how Processors read / modify
their data - their interactions with <span style="font-style: italic;">Data Access Objects</span>
and&nbsp; with external systems are not shown. It is also not shown
how entity beans are persisted - they also go through the DAOs.<br>


The <span style="font-style: italic;">Business Delegates</span>
uses the <span style="font-style: italic;">Service Locator</span>
to locate the <span style="font-style: italic;">Session
Beans, </span>and this is not shown in the sequence diagrams.<br>


Since my software does not support conditional flow in sequence
diagrams, this is handled with comments. My software does not support
including use cases and that is why included use cases are objects in
the sequence diagrams.

<h1>ASSUMPTIONS</h1>


<h2>CLIENTS</h2>


<br>


Both a Swing Application and a Web application will be created. These
two applications will share a common back end, which will contain the
Enterprise Java Beans and the Data Store. <br>


They will have a common code base for the following components in the
Front End : Business Delegate, Commands,
ServiceLocator, Context Object.<br>


They will have different&nbsp; implementations for the following
components: <br>

<br>


<h2>APPLICATION STRUCTURE</h2>


<h3>ACTORS</h3>


<br>


There are two main types of actor : the customer and the travel agent.
The sequence
diagrams refer to the web application, which is supposed to be used by
the customer. In all of the use cases the main actor may be either the
travel agent or the customer. If the main actor is the travel agent I
am assuming&nbsp;he has selected a customer first (in the Select
Customer use case) and the Customer data has been put&nbsp; into
the Context Object. If the
main actor is the Customer, then he has already been saved into
the Context Object (after logging in).<br>


<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">WORKFLOW</h3>


In the Web Application, the information is submitted from the <span style="font-style: italic;">View</span> to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Front controller</span>,
which according to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Request</span>
will put data&nbsp; into the <span style="font-style: italic;">Context
Object .</span>&nbsp;The <span style="font-style: italic;">Context
Object</span> contains data which has been submitted by the <span style="font-style: italic;">View</span> and the <span style="font-style: italic;">Command</span> which must
be executed. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Context
Object</span> is retrieved from and saved into the<span style="font-style: italic;"> HttpSession.</span><br>


The <span style="font-style: italic;">Front Controller </span>then
delegates control to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Application
Controller</span>, which will then use the information in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Context Object &nbsp;</span>to
execute a<span style="font-style: italic;"> Command</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br>


The Swing Application does not have a <span style="font-style: italic;">Front Controller</span>.
When an event is fired in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Client</span>,
&nbsp;the SwingApplicationController will fill the <span style="font-style: italic;">Context Object</span> with
the necessary data and execute the required <span style="font-style: italic;">Command.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">


<br>


The <span style="font-style: italic;">Command</span>
will use the data which has been put into the <span style="font-style: italic;">Context Object</span> and
call methods in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Business
Delegate</span>s to perform the necessary operations. <br>


The <span style="font-style: italic;">Business Delegates </span>will
use a <span style="font-style: italic;">Service Locator </span>to
find the <span style="font-style: italic;">Stateless
Session Beans (</span>using JNDI<span style="font-style: italic;">),</span> which will
perform the&nbsp; business operations. They may use other <span style="font-style: italic;">Session Beans</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Entity Beans,</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Data Access Objects</span>
or &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Connectors </span>to
external system for this.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">
</span>There is a <span style="font-style: italic;">data
access object</span> layer, where all the <span style="font-style: italic;">Data Store</span> access
methods are located. &nbsp;Both <span style="font-style: italic;">Session Beans</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Entity Beans</span> use
this layer.<br>


<br>


The data which has been retrieved from the back end will be put by the <span style="font-style: italic;">Command</span>&nbsp;
into the <span style="font-style: italic;">Context Object</span>.
Control is then returned to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Application
Controller</span> which will then forward to the appropriate <span style="font-style: italic;">View.<br>


</span>The <span style="font-style: italic;">View</span>
will then ask the <span style="font-style: italic;">View
Helpers</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Value
List Handlers</span> to retrieve the data from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Context Object </span>and
then will format and show it.<br>


In the Swing Application the <span style="font-style: italic;">Value
List Handler</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">View
Helpers</span> are ordinary Java Classes which I will not show in
the Component Diagram.<br>


I am assuming that the <span style="font-style: italic;">Value
List Collections,&nbsp;</span>
which are returned from the back end layer in the described use cases,
are reasonably small, so the front end will not need to query the back
end again when paging through the data. <br>


<br>


<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">STATE
INFORMATION</span></h3>


<br>


I decided not to use <span style="font-style: italic;">Stateful
Session Beans. </span>There are no requirements which would make
this strictly necessary (such as distributed user sessions), so for the
sake
of simplicity I will keep my state information in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Context Object</span>,<br>


The <span style="font-style: italic;">View Helpers</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span>will
retrieve the necessary state information from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Context Object</span>.
&nbsp;Both the <span style="font-style: italic;">Swing
Application</span> and the <span style="font-style: italic;">Web
Application</span> will create and use instances of <span style="font-style: italic;">Context Object</span> <br>


In the <span style="font-style: italic;">Web Application</span>,
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Front Controller</span>
will process the&nbsp;HttpRequest&nbsp; to fill the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Context Object, </span>which
will be kept in the <span style="font-style: italic;">HttpSession</span>.
<h3>DOMAIN MODEL : ENTITY BEANS</h3>


The <span style="font-style: italic;">Entity
beans&nbsp;</span>in the&nbsp; Domain Model &nbsp;are:<br>


<ul>


  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Customer : </span>Every
user has a Customer profile . A Customer may have Credit Card
information and other&nbsp; information, which is stored along with
the
customer data. The Customer &nbsp;will be also a <span style="font-style: italic;">Composite Entity Bean.&nbsp;</span>Details
about what should be stored into it (address, telephone, email..) are
not specified.&nbsp;</li>


  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">User</span>
: Here are
registered all users who are allowed to use the system : customers,
travel agents, administrators. A user has one or more <span style="font-style: italic;">roles,&nbsp;</span>
the user-role associations are loaded together with the user.
Association with a Customer Entity must also be stored</li>


  <li>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Itinerary
:</span> An unpaid Itinerary is a <span style="font-style: italic;">Composite Entity Bean </span>and
will be saved as a collection of segments. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Entity Beans</span> will
use <span style="font-style: italic;">Data Access Objects</span>
to make sure both Itineraries and Segments are
saved
correctly into the <span style="font-style: italic;">Data
Store</span>. The Segment contains necessary information to
identify the Flight and the Seat Reservation. An Itinerary is
associated with a Customer. An unpaid
Itinerary is also saved into the <span style="font-style: italic;">Data
Store</span>. Prices for an itinerary are calculated using&nbsp;the PriceProcessor. When an Itinerary is associated with a Payment
(by Credit Card or Award)&nbsp; it has been paid (there
is&nbsp; a flag) and won't be deleted by the cleanup job.</li>


  <li>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Seat Reservation : </span>When
a Seat in an Equipment&nbsp; is reserved, a Seat Reservation object
is
created. A
Seat Reservation is identified&nbsp; by an Equipment, a Seat and
the Customer who reserved. A seat may be reserved for an unpaid
itinerary and a Seat Reservation may be cancelled (if the user changes
itinerary or if he is unable to pay) . While theoretically a Seat
Reservation may&nbsp; reference just&nbsp; the Seat and the
Customer, in my
model a Seat is a "dumb" object which does not know about the Equipment
it
is in, and this is why a Seat Reservation references&nbsp; the
Equipment as well. This allows also to retrieve in a pass all Seats
in an Equipment which are available. &nbsp;I don't allow
overbooking.<br>


When confirming an itinerary, for every segment an association to one
or several Seat Reservation is created.<br>


When a customer pays for his Seat Reservations in an Equipment, the
flag Paid is set to true. Then the Seat Reservation won't be removed
&nbsp;by the cleanup job</li>


  <li>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Payment
: </span>Every
Payment is associated with a Customer and an Itinerary. Payment
information must be tracked, this is why this information needs to be
persistent. The credit card which was used and &nbsp;the
Transmaster
transaction identifier e.g. will be saved. A Payment may be by Credit
Card (CreditCardPayment) or Award &nbsp;(AwardPayment), which are
Payment's subclasses. This should simplify mapping to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Data Store</span>. I
assume&nbsp;payment is an atomic operation : you either pay fully
or
you don't.</li>


</ul>


<ul>


</ul>


These objects may exist also as <span style="font-style: italic;">Value
Objects </span>in the Front End.<br>


For persistence, I am planning to use <span style="font-style: italic;">Bean Managed Persistence</span>
in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Data Access
Objects</span> .Third party tools
(like Hibernate or IBATIS) , JPA,&nbsp; object oriented databases,
or simple JDBC calls, may be used. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Data Store</span>
will be managed by the <span style="font-style: italic;">Data
Access Objects</span> and will
be transparent to the rest of the application. I chose BMP over CMP
because of portability and more flexibility in persisting <span style="font-style: italic;">Composite Entity Beans.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">


<br>


<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">STATELESS
SESSION BEANS - PROCESSORS</span></h3>


There are&nbsp; Stateless Session Beans who&nbsp; work as<span style="font-style: italic;"> &nbsp;Business Objects </span>and
contain methods which encapsulate the required atomic business
operations. The methods may create <span style="font-style: italic;">Entity
Beans</span> if required. Or may just query the data store and
return a list of <span style="font-style: italic;">Value
Objects, </span>using the <span style="font-style: italic;">Fast
Lane Reader </span>pattern, when retrieving data.<br>


I will call these Stateless Session Beans <span style="font-style: italic;">Processors.</span><br>


There will be these <span style="font-style: italic;">Processors</span>:<br>


<br>


<ul style="font-weight: bold;">


  <li>CustomerProcessor : <span style="font-weight: normal;">to
create customers, log in, retrieve customer information</span></li>


  <li>SeatProcessor :&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: normal;">to
reserve seats on a flight (equipment), to verify their availability, to
filter out
reserved seats in an equipment, to retrieved all reserved / free seats
in an
equipment</span></li>


  <li>ItineraryProcessor : <span style="font-weight: normal;">to
persist, create, modify and retrieve itineraries</span></li>


  <li>SearchProcessor : <span style="font-weight: normal;">to
retrieve Flight timetables and distances according to user-entered
search criteria</span></li>


  <li><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">PriceProcessor : </span>to
calculate the price of an Itinerary or a Flight <br>


    </span></li>


  <li>PaymentProcessor : &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: normal;">to pay for Itineraries</span></li>


  <li>MileageProcessor : <span style="font-weight: normal;">to
retrieve and update mileage information for a Customer and to create
new
Mileage Accounts -&nbsp; interfaces to&nbsp; the legacy
application</span></li>


  <li>TransmasterProcessor : <span style="font-weight: normal;">to pay for an itinerary
-&nbsp; interfacing to the Transmaster external system</span></li>


</ul>


<span style="font-style: italic;">Note</span> :
Information about Flight timetables and prices, Flight Equipment
(Seats), Prices are not to be modified by the Travel System
Application, and
are fed into the data store by other applications. <br>


I will have <span style="font-style: italic;">Data Access
Objects</span> which&nbsp;contain
methods&nbsp; returning
a list of flight timetables and prices (filtered by the search
criteria) or seats (in an equipment). Mixing in the Travel System
Application
data I will be able to retrieve information about
available Seats on a Flight.<br>


I assume these data&nbsp; may be changed by external systems any
time
so they cannot be cached or in any way managed by the Travel System
Application.<br>


<br>


<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">STATELESS
SESSION BEAN - EJBCONTROLLER<br>


<br>


</span><small>I have chosen to use a stateless session
beans
(<span style="font-style: italic;">EjbController</span>)
as well for atomic operations which span over several
processor calls, so that the
transactions for these operations can be easily managed by the
container. <br>


If something goes wrong during one of these operations (e.g. a seat has
already been reserved), the entire operation will be rolled back.<br>


In a different type of architecture, this would be a <span style="font-style: italic;">stateful session bean , </span>but
here I made it stateless&nbsp; because I am already keeping the
state information in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Context
Object.<br>


<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br>


</span>There are following operations in the <span style="font-style: italic;">EJBController</span> bean:<br>


</small></big>
<ul style="font-weight: bold;">


  <li><big><small>doPayment : <span style="font-weight: normal;">to pay for un unpaid itinerary</span></small></big></li>


  <li><big><small>doConfirmItinerary : <span style="font-weight: normal;">to confirm an itinerary and
reserve seats</span></small></big></li>


  <li><big><small>doAwardTravel : <span style="font-weight: normal;">to book an award travel</span></small></big></li>


  <li><big><small><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">doDeleteSegment</span>: to
delete a segment and the associated seat reservation</span></small></big></li>


  <li><big><small><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">doCreateCustomer : </span>to
create customers<br>


    </span></small></big></li>


</ul>


<big><small>There is only one <span style="font-style: italic;">EJBController</span>,
because there are few operations and the&nbsp;methods will not be
very long.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">EJBCommand</span>
&nbsp;objects may be considered to encapsulate these operations
(not shown in the architecture).<br>


</small></big>
<h3>MESSAGE BEANS</h3>


There will be only one message bean:<br>


<ul>


  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">EmailProcessor
: </span>An EmailProcessor (a Message Bean) is used to send
Emails. It uses JavaMail.</li>


</ul>


<h3>VALUE OBJECTS</h3>


<br>


<h3><small><span style="font-weight: normal;">There
are other objects in the domain model which are not persisted by the
Travel System Application and exist in the application only as <span style="font-style: italic;">Value Objects</span>,
either because they do not need to be persistent or because they are
retrieved from an external system or the <span style="font-style: italic;">Data Store</span> and are
read only.&nbsp; </span></small></h3>


<ul style="font-weight: bold;">


  <li>Seat : &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: normal;">A
Seat <span style="font-style: italic;">Value Object</span>
contains information about
his position in an equipment, his class (first Class / Coach)
and&nbsp; a
flag (available / not available). It is contained in an
Equipment.&nbsp;</span></li>


  <li>Flight :<span style="font-weight: normal;">
Read only; it is
retrieved by the SearchProcessor and contains information about the
flight (flight number, departure and arrival cities, date, time)
.&nbsp;</span></li>


  <li>Segment : <span style="font-weight: normal;">This
information
is persistent and managed by the Travel System&nbsp;Application,
but it is
part of the Itinerary and is saved along with it.- &nbsp;A Segment
contains information about the flown distance as well</span></li>


  <li>MileageAccount : <span style="font-weight: normal;">It
is retrieved&nbsp; by the MileageProcessor. Contains mileage
information (Mileage) which is updated by the Travel
System Application and given back to the MileageProcessor&nbsp;</span></li>


  <li>Price : <span style="font-weight: normal;">Associated
with a Itinerary or a Flight and calculated by the PriceProcessor,
using as argument either a Flight or Itinerary. Price calculation could
vary over time and this is why it is kept in a separate component. Will
contain amount and currency.</span></li>


  <li>FlightSearchCriteria : <span style="font-weight: normal;">Value Object which is filled by
the View and used to perform searches with the SearchProcessor</span>&nbsp;</li>


  <li>Equipment&nbsp;:&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: normal;">contains
information about the Plane and the seat layout for a Flight. It is
read only, because it is not modified by the Travel </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">System</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> application. It is retrieved
by the SeatProcessor</span></li>


  <li style="font-weight: bold;"><big style="font-weight: normal;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Role : </span>basically an
enumerated type ( Customer, Travel Agent, Administrator)<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></small><br>


    </big></li>


</ul>


<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
</span><big><br>


</big>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><big>EXTERNAL
INTERFACES</big><br>


<br>


</span>The only information which is not available in the data
store
and cannot be accessed &nbsp;directly by the J2EE application is
the
Transmaster (to process payments) and the Frequent Flyer Mileage system.<br>


Both will be encapsulated by <span style="font-style: italic;">Business
Objects</span> which will work as <span style="font-style: italic;">Adapters . </span>The
implementation details are left to the developers<span style="font-style: italic;">. </span>For
Transmaster JAX-RPC will be probably be used and for the Frequent Flyer
Mileage System a screen scraper may be the easiest solution, or
alternatively accessing the back-end database.<br>


<br>


<br>


<br>


<h3>BUSINESS DELEGATES</h3>


The <span style="font-style: italic;">Business Delegates</span>
encapsulate access to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Stateless
Session Beans</span> and use a <span style="font-style: italic;">Service Locator</span> to
locate them. They may cache <span style="font-style: italic;">Session
Bean</span> handles<br>


The <span style="font-style: italic;">Business Delegates</span>
either talk to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Processors</span>
( for simple, read-only operations) or to the <span style="font-style: italic;">EjbController</span> (for
complex, transactional operations)<br>


There is going to be a <span style="font-style: italic;">Business
Delegate</span> for every remote Session Bean
which needs to be accessed. Every <span style="font-style: italic;">Business
Delegate</span> inherits from a
common ancestor class, which contains the common functionality.<br>


<br>


<h3>WEB COMMANDS</h3>


The Web Commands are coarse-grained unities of work, used both by the
Swing
and the Web application. They delegate to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Business Delegate</span>s
to perform the
atomic business operation supplied by the <span style="font-style: italic;">EjbController</span>
Session Beans, or to retrieve the necessary data from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Processor</span> Session
Beans.<br>


<br>


<h3>JOBS</h3>


There are&nbsp; going to be cleanup jobs, which will remove (after
a fixed time):<br>


<ul>


  <li>Unpaid&nbsp;Seat Reservations&nbsp;</li>


  <li>Unpaid&nbsp;Itineraries </li>


  <li>Users who have not confirmed their registrations</li>


</ul>


<br>


For that,
creation date needs to be saved along with these objects.<br>


<br>


<h3>WEB APPLICATION</h3>


The customers goes through a Model 2 web application (Model, View,
Controller). The View is rendered by JSP pages. The Model
&nbsp;objects are plain Java objects (POJOs) which are accessed
through Tag Libraries. Controller components are to be defined : <span style="font-style: italic;">Front Controller</span> to
parse the request and fill the <span style="font-style: italic;">Context
Object</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Application
Controller</span> for managing the workflow and executing <span style="font-style: italic;">Command</span>s.<br>


A web framework may be internally developed for this task, or
third-party tools like the WAF from the Java Petstore Demo or Webwork
may be used. <br>


<span style="font-style: italic;">Context Object</span>
and Commands should be used also by the <span style="font-style: italic;">Swing Application<br>


</span>The Web Server will have to configured so that connections
may be allowed only through HTTPS.<br>


<br>


<h3>SWING APPLICATION</h3>


I am assuming the Swing Application will be developed by the same team
which is developing the Web Application, so they will know how to reuse
the Business Objects and the parts which are common between the two. I
am assuming the travel agents will access the swing application either
from inside the intranet or through a Virtual Private Network, so that
the HTTPS requirement is not going to be an issue for the swing
application.
<h3>FILTERS</h3>


In the <span style="font-style: italic;">Web Application</span>,
everytime the user submits information through
the view, he goes through a SignOn<span style="font-style: italic;">
Filter.</span> This signon <span style="font-style: italic;">Filter</span>
checks
whether user information has been saved into the <span style="font-style: italic;">Context Object</span>, and
if
so, or if the requested URL does not require authentication, it
forwards to the servlet which will then perform the right command
according to the URL. If the user tries to perform actions in the
Travel
System Application which require authentication then the URL string is
saved
into the <span style="font-style: italic;">Context Object</span>
( for later redirection) and the SignOn use
case
is started. After successful signon the URL is retrieved from the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Context Object</span>,
and according to it the originally requested command is
executed.<br>


The Signon <span style="font-style: italic;">Filter</span>
is not shown in the sequence diagrams.<br>
